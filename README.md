This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started) using Ruby on Rails and React. It contains the basics for building a Shopify app.

Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](#installing-the-template).

## Benefits

- REST Admin API: Resource classes to interact with the API
